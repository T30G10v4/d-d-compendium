# D&D Compendium

Hi Adventurers!
I'm a Master and Player of D&D 5e, also a Full Stack Web Developer.
During my campaigns I usually take disordered notes of the informations on the sessions. In one of these sessions, I've lost some precius informations that ruins fun of all my group, so I decided to create some helpful tools that helps me to mantain all under my control.
These tools are made in pure HTML and CSS, no frameworks, with the goal to print them. I'm a fan of paper (recycled one as well) so I want to create some printable tools.

In the future, I can add some JavaScript to reuse some tools and components, who knows when..

Thank you for reading this (and sorry for my bad English XD)!
